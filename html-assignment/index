        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a student at Algonquin College, currently studying Interactive Media Design. I have a passion for design, technology, and creativity, which drives me to excel in my projects.</p>
        <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy working on personal design projects, watching films and various other medias to inspire my creativity, and exploring new ways to use technology for artistic expression. 
        My interest in technology began at a young age, as I was always fascinated about computers and their intricacies. I also have a deep interest in coding and web development. As someone who likes to immerse themselves in learning new skills, 
        I find web design to be a perfect blend of creativity and logic. My goal is to continually improve and eventually work on larger tech projects in the future.</p>
